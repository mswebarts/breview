Better review system for WooCommerce. The way reviews should be handled in every WooCommerce websites.

== Description ==

Wouldn’t it be awesome if the WooCommerce review system worked like other traditional e-commerce websites? Traditionally, e-commerce websites let customers place an order and the seller delivers the product. Once the order is completed, customers can leave a product review right from the order page.

This makes sure only customers who have purchased the product can provide a review. But unfortunately, WooCommerce review doesn’t work this way.

The plugin is full of very useful features like easy to configure cultiple criteria Ratings, review moderation, ajax review submission, Dokan multi-vendor Compatibility, Email Reminder and many more. We always keep updating the plugin and adding new features. We have some really cool feautures in queue in our development list. So, stay tuned for new updates.


== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

**Method One**

1. Download the plugin from your order page at MS Web Arts
2. Go to your wordpress admin dashboard -> Plugins -> Add New
3. Click on the "Upload Plugin" button
4. Upload the downloaded plugin zip file
5. Then activate it.

Once the plugin is activated, you will find a new admin menu named MS Web Arts in your Wordpress dashboard. Go to that menu. You will see that it's asking for a license code. Copy the license code that you got after purchasing Breview and pase it in the License code field. After the successful activation, a new submenu named Breview will appear below MS Web Arts. You can control all the settings of the plugin from that page.

Pro Tip: If you see any PHP warning in your site's frontend, just go to MS Web Arts -> Breview and click on the Save Settings button.

**Method Two**

1. Download the plugin from your order page at MS Web Arts
2. Connect to your hosting with an FTP account or File Manager in your Hosting account
3. Go to the WordPress installation directory -> wp-content -> plugins
4. Upload the downloaded plugin's uncompressed folder ( if using FTP ) or zip file ( if Hosting cPanel ). You must extract the file from hosting cPanel if you upload zip file
5. Then go to WordPress admin dashboard -> Plugins -> Installed Plugins -> Then activate Breview

Hope the installation process was as smooth as the plugin works!
