Collect and display customer reviews on your WooCommerce store. Breview allows customers to leave reviews on the order received page and display them on the product page.

== Description ==

Enhance your WooCommerce website review collection workflow by accepting reviews for products from the order page after completion similar to marketplaces like Amazon, eBay and AliExpress. Breview has mastered the review collection workflow that was missing in WooCommerce from the beginning but not ANYMORE!

Wouldn’t it be awesome if the WooCommerce review system worked like other traditional e-commerce websites? Traditionally, e-commerce websites let customers place an order and the seller delivers the product. Once the order is completed, customers can leave a product review right from the order page.

This makes sure only customers who have purchased the product can provide a review to the products only once for a purchase. But unfortunately, WooCommerce review doesn’t work this way. The default WC review system is more of a comment form with rating than an actual review system. With Breview, we have remastered the review workflow as it should be in every WooCommerce websites.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to remove PHP warnings in the review tab? =

The review tab may display a warning after you activate the plugin and the license. You just need to go to your WordPress site’s admin panel -> MS Web Arts -> Breview and then just click on the Save Settings button. This will save the settings in the database and the warnings will go away.

You can update the plugin using WordPress's automatic and manual update options.
